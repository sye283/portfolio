            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Problem </h1>
            <p class = "project_section"> Travel planning is considerably inefficient and disorganized. Based on our survey for college students,
            83% express that planning group trips involves more hassle and stress than they would like. 76% cite that they have had difficulties in
            coordinating bookings with friends. In 2018, 1.4B people traveled globally, with this number projected to rise each year*.
            With tourism being such a major component to the global economy, now is the perfect time to redesign the group travel experience into something much more fun, efficient, and elegant.</p>
            <p style = "color: #ADADAD; font-size: 0.7rem !important;">*projections, research/surveys, and ideation of Bridge Travel all from pre-pandemic times </p>

            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Solution </h1>
            <p class = "project_section"> Bridge Travel is a social platform with all the tools needed to effectively plan trips with friends and family. <br><br>
              <b>Our 2-pronged value proposition differentiates us from typical travel booking sites: </b></p>

            <img src = "./images/valueprop.png" style = "width: 100%;">
            <p class = "project_section"><br>No more scrolling through hundreds of trivial chats to find flight details. No more constant nagging of your friends to plan activities. No more searching
            through scattered emails to find e-tickets. All you need is Bridge Travel.</p>

            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Revenue Model </h1>
              <p> Bridge Travel takes 15% commission on flights and accomodations booked through our platform.
                Based on our competitor research, this is a smaller commission than that of many of our competitors, making us an attractive
                team to partner with.<br><br>

                Our platform will be completely free to use by consumers. In the future, we will add in purchasable premium features
                and adopt a freemium model towards consumers.
               </p>


            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Market Opportunity </h1>

            </div>

            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Value Proposition Canvas </h1>
            <p>Our team used research, user interviews, and surveys to refine our value proposition and ensure
            that we are addressing consumers' pain points in the most effective way. We leveraged this canvas
            in the planning and designing of the platform.</p>

            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Minimum Viable Product </h1>
            <p>After several usability tests and multiple design iterations, we had our MVP.
            <br>A few key features include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Book flights and hotels directly from the platform</p></li>
              <li><p>A dashboard to easily manage all your upcoming trips and view details from your past trips if needed</p></li>
              <li><p>Add friends to your trips to collect and share relevant travel planning information</p></li>
              <li><p>Talk with your travel group directly through the Trip portal</p></li>
              <li><p>See who has booked what tickets. Send reminder alerts to friends who are procrastinating.</p></li>
              <li><p>Compile all e-tickets and receipts for flights and activities for easy access during trip</p></li>
              <li><p>Assign tasks to people to easily split planning responsibilities</p></li>
