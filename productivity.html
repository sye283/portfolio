            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Background </h1>
            <p class = "project_section"> Life is complicated! Between all our responsibilities, events, tasks and thoughts,
            it's not fair to ask our brains to remember and manage everything. Many consumers today rely on multiple
            productivity apps to manage their daily lives. I personally have separate tools for calendars, to-do lists,
            general lists, quick personal notes, more organized notes, and planning, on top of the team-based tools used at work.
            Hours are wasted each week switching between these different products, syncing through various platforms,
            and often losing valuable information along the way. For tools that are supposed to make life more efficient, they sure
            seem inefficient. Born out of this frustruation, Faire is the product that ties it all together.
            A seamless combination of calendars, lists, notes, and more to manage <b><i>all</i></b> aspects of our lives.
          </p>

            <h1 class = "project_sectiontitle"> Market opportunity </h1>
            <p class = "project_section"> Current productivity apps usually focus on just one thing: calendars, to-do lists, or notes,
              but rarely all three. The few apps that try to provide comprehensive tools are still clearly optimized for one purpose.
              As a result, we're left to rely on different apps for each purpose. Furthermore, most productivity
              platforms are web-centric, with mobile experiences that are either challenging to navigate or overly simplified
              to the point of being impractical. However, for someone like me who is often on the go with just my phone,
              a robust mobile experience is essential. Faire perfectly fills this market gap -
              the single source for individual productivity management, optimized for mobile.
